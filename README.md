# Methods-in-Bioinformatics
Applying machine learning approaches to important biological questions.

# Transmembrane-proteins
Uses python scikit-learn HMM and SVM models to predict transmembrane protein class (alpha helix, beta barrel, other)

# HCV1-NS5A
Uses MATLAB bioinformatics toolkit to generate PHMM for predicting HCV type 1 subtype (a or b) from NS5A (contains
ISDR - interferon sensitivity determining region). Studies implicate HCV1 subtypes respond differently to
treatment, suggesting NS5A may be correlated to interferon-ribavirin sensitivity. Paper included.
